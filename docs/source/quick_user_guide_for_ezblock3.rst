Quick User Guide for Ezblock 3
=====================================

About Ezblock 3
----------------------

Compared with the Bluetooth communication of EzBlock 2, EzBlock 3 uses Websocket to communicate, which is much faster.

To make it faster and easier to use, we have optimized the connection and usage process so that you can learn programming quickly with Ezblock Studio.

The Ezblock 3 version should be used with the Ezblock 3 image (`Ezblock Studio Download Center <https://ezblock.cc/download/index.html>`_.). The v3.0 version is currently in the public test stage. 

Ezblock 3 is still in public beta. Please do not hesitate to point out any inconveniences or errors, and any suggestions are welcome.
