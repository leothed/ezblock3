About Ezblock 3
----------------------

The biggest optimization of Ezblock App upgrade from Ezblock 2 to Ezblock 3 is to modify the communication method, Compared with the Bluetooth communication of EzBlock 2, EzBlock 3 uses Websocket to communicate, which is much faster.

For the Ezblock 3 version, To make it faster and easier to use, we have optimized the connection and usage process so that you can learn programming quickly with Ezblock Studio.

The Ezblock 3 should be used with the Ezblock 3 image (`Ezblock Studio Download Center <https://ezblock.cc/download/index.html>`_.). 

Ezblock 3 is still in public beta. Please do not hesitate to point out any inconveniences or errors, and any suggestions are welcome.
